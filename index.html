            <h2>Embrace Diversity While Rock Climbing</h2>
            <h4>9/17/2022</h4>

        <p>
            Yesterday, I went to the BIPOC + QT Rock Climbing Extravaganza! event at <strong>[Undisclosed University]</strong> 
            Along wih other BIPOC (Black Indigenous People of Color) I climbed for freedom and inclusion. 
            There were around 40 BIPOC students throughout the 2 hour event period and we all talked and climbed. 
            It was a really fun experience, and I can't wait to do it again.

        <p>
            Yesterday, I went to <strong>[Undisclosed University]</strong> climbing wall. 
            I climbed five routes, ranging from 5.6 difficulty to 5.9. 
            I enjoy rock climbing because it's a complete body exercise, you aren't just doing aerobic or strength training but using your mind as well. 
            Rock climbing requires you to plan out your moves and where you are going to climb, unlike other sports where it is more doing something mindlessly. 
            I like to climb several times per week, after my classes.

            <h2>Socialisim in Rock Climbing</h2>
            <h4>9/17/2022</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            I was rock climbing the other day when I realized how there is a strong sense of community and socialism among rock climbers, as people who share this hobby are typically drawn to each other by their shared passion. 
            This sense of community manifests itself in many ways, such as climbers sharing information about routes, helping each other with gear, and offering encouragement. 
            There is also a strong culture of safety in rock climbing, as climbers rely on each other to belay (rope-up) and spot (provide guidance) while climbing. 
            This reliance on each other creates a sense of trust and camaraderie among climbers.

            <h2>Rock Climbing on the Moon</h2>
            <h4>9/17/2022</h4>
            </p><p>
            Although lunar rock climbing may seem like science fiction, it might eventually become a reality thanks to recent technological breakthroughs. 
            Rock climbing on the moon would be an unusual and challenging experience due to the lack of gravity.
            <br> <br>
            Rock climbers would have to deal with low atmospheric pressure, making it difficult to breathe and keep a firm grip. 
            Because of the absence of gravity, they would also benefit from a lower body weight, facilitating some actions and climbs.
            <br> <br>
            The moon's surface is also much different than Earth's, with rocky and cratered terrain. 
            This could make for some exciting and challenging climbs, with climbers navigating through steep inclines, jagged edges, and rough surfaces.
            <br> <br>
            Rock climbers on the moon would need to use specialized gear and clothing to keep themselves safe from the hostile lunar environment. 
            They must also be cautious with their oxygen supply and prepare backup systems.
            <br> <br>
            For individuals who love adventure and pushing themselves to their limits, rock climbing on the moon would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience. 
            We expect an increase in the number of people taking on this great endeavor as technology develops and space flight becomes more widely available.

            <h2>The Economic Disparities of Rock Climbing</h2>
            <h4>9/17/2022</h4>
        </p>
        <p>
            Rock climbing is a popular sport among all types of people, but it is not without <strong>economic disparities</strong>. 
            Climbing can be a low-cost hobby for some, requiring only a pair of shoes and a chalk bag to get started, but it can also be an expensive pursuit. 
            Rock climbing equipment such as ropes, harnesses, and protection can quickly add up, and climbing gyms frequently charge exorbitant membership fees. 
            These costs can be prohibitive for those without the financial means to invest in the necessary equipment and access to indoor climbing facilities.
            <br> <br>
            For many climbers, outdoor climbing can be prohibitively expensive. 
            Travel expenses, guide fees, and the cost of specialized equipment required for certain types of climbing can make participation in outdoor climbing activities difficult, if not impossible, for climbers on a budget. 
            As a result, the sport may become exclusive to those with financial means, exacerbating economic disparities within the climbing community.
            <br> <br>
            Addressing the sport's economic disparities is critical to making it more accessible and inclusive. 
            This can be accomplished by providing more affordable gear options, providing financial assistance to low-income climbers, and developing community programs that provide free or reduced-cost access to climbing gyms and outdoor climbing areas. 
            We can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to experience the joys and challenges of climbing by working toward greater economic equity.
